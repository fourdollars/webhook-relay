title: Webhook Relay
summary: SSE webhook relay server with signature checking and encrypted payload support
description: |
  A Server-Sent Events (SSE) webhook relay server implemented in Rust.
  
  Supports two operational modes:
  - webhook: Acts as a relay server accepting webhook POST requests and broadcasting
    them via SSE to subscribed clients. Supports signature validation and optional
    encryption with public keys.
  - relayd: Acts as a relay client connecting to a webhook server, receiving and
    decrypting messages with a private key.
  
  Features:
  - HMAC signature validation (X-Hub-Signature, X-Gitlab-Token, X-Line-Signature)
  - Asymmetric encryption with RSA public/private keys
  - Channel-based message broadcasting
  - Automatic channel cleanup
  - Heartbeat/ping mechanism
