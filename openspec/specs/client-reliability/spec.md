# client-reliability Specification

## Purpose
This specification defines the reliability and resilience requirements for the webhook relay client. It ensures the client can detect server connection failures through heartbeat monitoring, automatically recover from temporary network or server issues through reconnection with exponential backoff, and gracefully exit with appropriate error codes when recovery is not possible. These capabilities prevent silent failures where webhooks might be missed without indication, and provide clear operational signals for monitoring and alerting systems.

## Requirements
### Requirement: Heartbeat Timeout Detection
The client SHALL monitor server ping events and detect when the heartbeat timeout is exceeded.

#### Scenario: Normal ping reception
- **WHEN** the client receives ping events from the server within the timeout period
- **THEN** the client continues normal operation without any reconnection attempts

#### Scenario: Heartbeat timeout detection
- **WHEN** no ping events are received for more than 30 seconds
- **THEN** the client SHALL detect this as a connection failure and initiate reconnection

### Requirement: Automatic Reconnection
The client SHALL attempt to reconnect to the server when connection failure is detected.

#### Scenario: Successful reconnection
- **WHEN** a connection failure is detected and the server becomes available
- **THEN** the client SHALL reconnect and resume receiving events

#### Scenario: Exponential backoff
- **WHEN** reconnection attempts fail
- **THEN** the client SHALL wait with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, max 30s) between attempts

#### Scenario: Connection re-establishment
- **WHEN** reconnection succeeds
- **THEN** the client SHALL reset the failure counter and resume normal heartbeat monitoring

### Requirement: Failure Recovery Limits
The client SHALL exit with an error code when maximum reconnection attempts are exhausted.

#### Scenario: Maximum attempts reached
- **WHEN** 5 consecutive reconnection attempts fail
- **THEN** the client SHALL exit with code 1 (connection failure)

#### Scenario: Process exit logging
- **WHEN** the client exits due to connection failure
- **THEN** it SHALL log the reason and total number of attempts made

### Requirement: Connection State Logging
The client SHALL provide visibility into connection health and reconnection attempts.

#### Scenario: Reconnection attempt logging
- **WHEN** a reconnection attempt is made
- **THEN** the client SHALL log the attempt number and next retry delay

#### Scenario: Heartbeat timeout logging
- **WHEN** heartbeat timeout is detected
- **THEN** the client SHALL log the time since last ping and timeout threshold
